 The cursor is used To execute a multi-row query, Oracle opens an unnamed work area that stores processing information.
 You can access this area through an explicit cursor, which names the work area, or through a cursor variable, which points to the work area. 
To create cursor variables, you define a REF CURSOR type, then declare cursor variables of that type.
DECLARE
TYPE customer_t IS REF CURSOR RETURN customers%rowtype;
     c_customer customer_t;
